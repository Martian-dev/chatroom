# CHATROOMS

made using: Socket.io, ExpressJs, HTML, and CSS

its a basic chatroom where the user can join a chatroom and talk and then leave.

## TODO

- UI/UX enhancements:
  - better styling overall.
  - copying the roomId button.
  - leaving the room only when pressed leave.
  - restoring room sessions (needs DB).
  - managing multiple rooms.
- Storing the Room details and chat details in a DB.
- Organize the project better, and modularize stuff.

Completely optional features:

- customizability for user profiles?
- authorizations perhaps?
